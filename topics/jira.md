You can integrate TeamCity with [Jira](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira) to provide links to Jira issues from the TeamCity UI. General information about the TeamCity integration with issue trackers is provided [here](integrating-teamcity-with-issue-tracker.md).

## Authentication

When configuring a connection to Jira, use the following authentication parameters:
* for self-managed Jira (Server or Data Center): username (specified in the Jira user profile) and password
* for Jira Cloud: user email and [API token](https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-basic-authentication/)

Since version 2020.1, TeamCity can report build statuses directly to Jira Cloud in real time. To configure this extra option, you need to provide the Jira _Client ID_ and _Server secret_ when configuring a connection and add a respective [build feature](jira-cloud-integration.md).
