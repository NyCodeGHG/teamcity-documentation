In TeamCity terms, a pipeline is called a _build chain_.

Builds are jobs that perform various CI/CD tasks. When you connect them into a sequence, they form a chain. Builds inside a chain can use the same revision of the source project and pass artifacts to one another.

Build chains can be quite complex and contain dozens of builds connected in series or in parallel. They are often designed to build, test, and deploy a certain project, but you can create them for any other goal.

Our sample chain consists of 6 builds. Let's create them one by one:
